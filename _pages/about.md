Hello! I'm a CV Starr Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/), where I am working with [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/), [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu), and [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). My work is at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning. I am particularly interested in how humans and artificial language models represent and integrate information in language. 

I obtained my PhD in [EECS at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/) and [Jack Gallant](https://www.gallantlab.org/news/), and was affiliated with [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu). During my PhD, I also had the opportunity to work with wonderful collaborators on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/about) team at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) and the [Denizens Lab](https://denizenslab.github.io/) at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/). My PhD was funded by a [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and an [IBM PhD Fellowship](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html). Before going to Berkeley, I was a [Fulbright Scholar](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) studying causal inference in neuroimaging with [Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/107192/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and [MPI Tuebingen](https://tuebingen.mpg.de/startseite/). Before that, I earned a BSE in Computer Science at [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/) with minors in Neuroscience, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Applied Math, and was fortunate to work with [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu), [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/), and [Zahra Aminzare](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~zaminzare/).

Outside of research I like to run, swim, and learn languages.
