Hello! My name is Cathy Chen. I'm an incoming PhD candidate in EECS at UC Berkeley, and am currently doing research in Germany on a Fulbright grant. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience, and I recently graduated with a BSE in Computer Science from Princeton with minors in Neuroscience, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Applied Math.

In my free time, I like running and playing tennis, violin, and chess. This year, Iâ€™m also working on improving my German and writing (not necessarily in German).
