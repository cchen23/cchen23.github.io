Hello! My name is Cathy Chen. I'm a PhD student in [EECS at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/) and [Jack Gallant](https://www.gallantlab.org/news/). I am affiliated with [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am interested in the intersection of natural language, cognitive neuroscience, and machine learning.

Before coming to Berkeley, I received a [Fulbright Student Grant](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to work on causal inference and neuroscience at [LMU Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and [MPI Tuebingen](https://tuebingen.mpg.de/startseite/), advised by [Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/107192/). I graduated with a BSE in Computer Science from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/) with minors in Neuroscience, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Applied Math. There, I had to privilege of working with [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu), [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/), and [Zahra Aminzare](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~zaminzare/).

Outside of research, I like to run, play tennis and guitar, and learn languages.
