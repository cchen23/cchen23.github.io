Hello! My name is Cathy Chen. I'm a PhD student in [EECS at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/) and [Jack Gallant](https://www.gallantlab.org/news/). I am affiliated with [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of language, cognitive neuroscience, and machine learning.

Before coming to Berkeley, I received a [Fulbright Student Grant](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to work on causal inference and neuroscience at [LMU Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and [MPI Tuebingen](https://tuebingen.mpg.de/startseite/), advised by [Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/107192/). I graduated with a BSE in Computer Science from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/) with minors in Neuroscience, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Applied Math. There, I had to privilege of working with [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu), [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/), and [Zahra Aminzare](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~zaminzare/).

Outside of research, I run, play tennis and guitar, and work on improving my German and Spanish.

## Past Research
* Causal Inference in fMRI Data (*in preparation*).
  * Showed prevalence of false positives when applying statistical causal inference methods to noisy data, even with simple model assumptions.
* Learning to Perform Dynamic Role-Filler Binding with Schematic Knowledge (*[CCN 2018](https://ccneuro.org/2018/)*). [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09006) [poster](/images/thesis_ccn_poster.png) [abstract](https://ccneuro.org/2018/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=1036)
  * Tested whether/how neural networks learn to perform dynamic role-filler binding, the ability to associate specific "fillers" with abstract "roles" by learning structural relationships underlying specific experiences.
* A Temporal Decay Model for Mapping between fMRI and Natural Language Annotations *([CCN 2017](https://ccneuro.org/2017/index.html))*. [abstract](https://www2.securecms.com/CCNeuro/docs-0/591d7d2668ed3f3154cce90a.pdf) 
  * Studied the influence on exponential decay parameters to integrate information in models that predict between fMRI brain scans of subjects watching a movie and external text annotations of the same movie.
* Decision Making in Heterogeneous Drift Diffusion Networks [slides](https://github.com/cchen23/heterogeneous_DDM_networks/blob/master/slides.pdf) [report](https://github.com/cchen23/heterogeneous_DDM_networks/blob/master/written_report.pdf) *([PACM](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu) Undergraduate Certificate Colloquium 2018)*
  * Characterized decision dynamics in groups of hetereogeneous individuals that accumulate information according to the drift-diffusion model.
