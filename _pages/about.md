Hello! My name is Cathy Chen. I'm an incoming PhD candidate in [EECS at UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), and am currently doing research in Germany on a [Fulbright](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) grant. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and cognition, and I recently graduated with a BSE in Computer Science from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/) with minors in Neuroscience, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Applied Math.

In my free time, I like running and playing tennis, violin, and chess. This year, Iâ€™m also working on my German and writing (not necessarily in German).
