I served as an instructor at [Princeton AI4ALL](http://ai4all.princeton.edu/), a summer program designed to teach AI to rising 11th grade students from underrepresented groups. I gave lectures about the fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning and led a research group about using NLP for social good.
