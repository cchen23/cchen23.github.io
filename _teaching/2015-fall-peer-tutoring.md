I worked as a peer tutor for three years, tutoring Linear Algebra (MAT202), Introductory Computer Science (COS126), and Algorithms & Data Structures (COS226) through the [McGraw Center](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton undergraduate tutoring program](https://odoc.princeton.edu/support/finding-help-academic-work/individual-peer-tutoring).
